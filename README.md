# SyncUp!

SyncUp is my project for a social network website, written in React.js with Typescript and styled with Tailwind. Among the core highlights of this project are:

- Dynamic styling with TailwindCSS to make colors and font-sizes across the page easy to change.
- Reusable Components using design patterns (i.e: Compound components) and SOLID principles.
- Internationalization with react-i18next.
- Validated forms with react-hook-form and yup. 
- Formatting and linting with Prettier and eslint.
- Bundled with vite
- and more!
